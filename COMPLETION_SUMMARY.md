## 🚀 WHAT MAKES THIS SPECIAL

### 1. **Book-First Design** 🎯
Unlike generic business apps, DreamBig OS is built around the books users already own. The app becomes an extension of their learning.

### 2. **Context-Aware Guidance** 📖
Alerts don't just warn—they educate by referencing specific book chapters.

### 3. **Mistake Prevention** 🛡️
Proactive warnings before problems occur, not reactive dashboards.

### 4. **Zimbabwean-First** 🇿🇼
Built for USD/ZWL volatility, inflation, and informal business realities.

### 5. **Execution-Focused** ⚡
Not a learning app—an execution engine. Tools over content.

### 6. **Smart Simplicity** ✨
Features appear when needed (book-based), disappear when not. No clutter.
